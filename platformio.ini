description = ESPKey firmware by Kenny McElroy. This sketch runs on the ESPKey ESP8266 module carrier with the intent of being physically attached to the Wiegand data wires between a card reader and the local control box. Hardware can be purchased or have a look in the hardware directory if you want to build your own.
